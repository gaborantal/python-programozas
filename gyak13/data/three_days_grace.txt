I came along for the ride
You're wicked with the clutch
Happened so fast and it hurt so much
You're a car crash
And I can't look away
I should have known by now
I'm still not afraid
I do it to myself
No is what I never say
You're a car crash
And I can't look away

All I see is shattered glass and
Red lights passing
My life flashing!
Headed for the same disaster
Faster and faster and faster

I couldn't stop at the red light
Stop at the red light
I couldn't stop at the red light
You're a car crash
And I can't look away

I came along for the ride
You're wicked with the clutch
Happened so fast and it hurt so much
You're a car crash
And I can't look away

And all I see is shattered glass and
Red lights passing
My life flashing!
Headed for the same disaster
Faster and faster and faster

I couldn't stop at the red light
The red light
Stop at the red light
I couldn't stop at the red light
You're just like a car crash
And I can't look away
From the headlights
The red light
Stop at the red light
I couldn't stop at the red light
You're just like a car crash
And I can't look away!

And all I see is shattered glass and
Red lights passing
(Let's go for a ride!)
Headed for the same disaster
Faster and faster and faster

I couldn't stop at the red light
The red light
Stop at the red light
I couldn't stop at the red light
You're just like a car crash
And I can't look away
From the headlights
The red light
Stop at the red light
I couldn't stop at the red light
You're just like a car crash
Like a car crash!
And I can't look away!




I'm done feeling like this
So down, so dark, so numb
And I'm done feeling like this
Like I did something wrong

I miss the way it used to be
When we were family

Now I hate you
I only ever see you on Wednesdays
And every other weekend
What made you think it was OK to run away?
I'm going off the deep end

I miss the way it used to be
When we were family
Now I hate you
I only ever see you on Wednesdays
And every other weekend

I can't understand how we could come undone
Is love really that bad that you have to turn and run?

I miss the way it used to be
When we were family

Now I hate you
I only ever see you on Wednesdays
And every other weekend
What made you think it was OK to run away?
I'm going off the deep end

I miss the way it used to be
When we were family
Now I hate you
I only ever see you on Wednesdays
And every other weekend

Maybe someday you'll see it my way
When worlds apart is just too hard to take
You're here and now you're gone
And I can't move on

I can't understand how we could come undone
Is love really that bad that you have to turn and run?

Now I hate you
I only ever see you on Wednesdays
And every other weekend
What made you think it was OK to run away?
I'm going off the deep end

I miss the way it used to be
When we were family
Now I hate you
I only ever see you on Wednesdays
And every other weekend




Late at night I could hear the crying
I hear it all, trying to fall asleep
When all the love around you is dying

How do you stay so strong?
How did you hide it all for so long?
How can I take the pain away?
How can I save

A fallen angel, in the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel

You do it all for my own protection
You make me feel like I'll be okay
Still I have so many questions

How do you stay so strong?
How did you hide it all for so long?
How can I take the pain away?
How can I save

A fallen angel, in the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel, just let go
You don't have to be alone
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight

I was right beside you
When you went to hell and back again
I was right beside you
When you went to hell and back again
And I, I couldn't save, a fallen angel

A fallen angel, in the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel, just let go
You don't have to be alone
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel




I don't belong here
Not in this atmosphere
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye
I don't belong here
Not in this atmosphere
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye

Started with a kick and a punch
A claw to the face
And I was in the race
I was in the race
Yeah, yeah
You know it's hard sometimes
Being humankind
Keeping up with the pace
Keeping up with the pace
Yeah, yeah
I'm sick of running
Sick of running
Sick of running
The Human Race
The Human Race

If it's an eye for an eye
Then we all go blind
Is it hard to see?
Is it hard to see?
Yeah, yeah
So far behind
No finish line
It can happen to you
It can happen to me
Yeah

I don't belong here
Not in this atmosphere
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye

Here's to being human
All the pain and suffering
There's beauty in the bleeding
At least you feel something

I wish I knew what it was like
To care enough to carry on
I wish I knew what it was like
To find a place where I belong, but

I am machine
I never sleep
I keep my eyes wide open
I am machine
A part of me
Wishes I could just feel something
I am machine
I never sleep
Until I fix what's broken
I am machine
A part of me
Wishes I could just feel something

Here's to being human
Taking it for granted
The highs and lows of living
To getting second chances

I wish I knew what it was like
To care about what's right or wrong
I wish someone could help me find
Find a place where I belong, but

I am machine
I never sleep
I keep my eyes wide open
I am machine
A part of me
Wishes I could just feel something
I am machine
I never sleep
Until I fix what's broken
I am machine
A part of me
Wishes I could just feel something

It wasn't supposed to be this way
We were meant to feel the pain
I don't like what I am becoming
Wish I could just feel something

I am machine
I never sleep
I keep my eyes wide open
I am machine
A part of me
Wishes I could just feel something
I am machine
I never sleep
Until I fix what's broken
I am machine
A part of me
Wishes I could just feel something




Under the Surface
(Under the Surface)
Wires are crossed
(Wires are crossed)
At any moment
(At any moment)
I could go off!

And I can't hold much longer
It keeps getting stronger
It's only a matter of time!

I'm living like a landmine
Waiting to explode!
I'm ticking like a time-bomb
Ready to go!
I'm a danger to myself
And everybody else

Under the pressure

I live in denial

I always shoot first
Never ask questions
Never think of consequences
I didn't feel a thing
I didn't feel a thing

I never think twice
No intentions
Never feel the consequences
Until it starts to sting
Until it starts to sting

No!
It never hurt like this before
No!
Nothing's fair in love and war!

Turn out the lights!
Nothing's fair in love and war!
It's too late tonight!
Nothing's fair in love and war!
Your hand
My knife
Your heart
My life
There's no wrong or right
When nothing's fair in love and war!

I never back down
Always in crisis
Left to my own devices
You never meant a thing
You never meant a thing

No!
It never hurt like this before
No!
Nothing's fair in love and war!

Turn out the lights!
Nothing's fair in love and war!
It's too late tonight!
Nothing's fair in love and war!

Gotta get my hands on it

Cause everybody wants
Everybody needs

You know you need a fix when you fall down
You know you need to find a way
To get you through another day
Let me be the one to numb you out
Let me be the one to hold you
Never gonna let you get away

The shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on

So what if I'm crazier than crazy?
So what if I'm sicker than sick?
So what if I'm out of control?
Maybe that's what I like about it

You can say that I'm going insane
And I'm not quite right
And that I'm to blame
You can say that I'm sick on the inside
Bet you don't know I like it that way
You can say whatever you like
If it's so wrong I don't wanna be right

So what if I'm crazier than crazy?
So what if I'm sicker than sick?
So what if I'm out of control?
Maybe that's what I like about it
So what?
So what?

You can say that I'm going insane
And I'm not quite right
And that I'm to blame
I don't care you can say what you want to
I am who I am and I'll never be like you
You can say whatever you like
If it's so wrong I don't wanna be right

So what if I'm crazier than crazy?
So what if I'm sicker than sick?
So what if I'm out of control?
Maybe that's what I like about it
So what?
So what?

And when I'm up
It's better than ever
And when I'm down
I'm desperate
And when I'm up
It's better than ever
And when I'm down
I'm desperate

How'd I wind up here again?
It's like I'm always getting blood on my hands
All it takes is one and I'm gone and a thousand 'til the end
How'd I wind up here again?

You take me to the edge
You push me too far
You watch me slip away
I'm holding on too hard

Tell me why!
Does everything that I love get taken away?
From me!
Why?
Does everything that I love get taken away?
You take me to the edge
Push me too far
Watch me slip away
Holding on too hard
Tell me
Why?
Does everything that I love get taken away?
From me?

How come nothing ever lasts?
It goes from good to bad to worse so fast
All it takes is one and I'm gone and you can't erase the past
How come nothing ever lasts?

You take me to the edge
You push me too far
You watch me slip away
Holding on too hard

Tell me why!
Does everything that I love get taken away?
From me!
Why?
Does everything that I love get taken away?
You take me to the edge
Push me too far
Watch me slip away
Holding on too hard!
Tell me
Why?!
Does everything that I love get taken away?
From me?
(From me?)

Here I am alone again
Alone again
Here I am alone again

How come nothing ever lasts?
It goes from good to bad to worse so fast

Tell me why!
Does everything that I love get taken away?
From me!
Why?
Does everything that I love get taken away?
You take me to the edge
Push me too far
Watch me slip away
Holding on too hard!
Tell me
Why?!
Does everything that I love get taken away?

Does everything that I love get taken away?

I know how it hurts
But I hate to hear those words
That you're good with being gone
And everything is wrong
Don't you give up now
We'll make it through somehow
There's lots of living left
In this life not the next

The end is not the answer
You and I are in this together!
Don't you give up ever
Cause the end is not the answer!

I know how it hurts
But I hate to hear those words
There's lots of living left
In this life not the next

The end is not the answer
You and I are in this together!
Don't you give up ever
Cause the end is not the answer!

Everybody gets hurt sometimes
Everybody gets lost sometimes
Nobody knows when it's their time
To go
To go
To go

The end is not the answer
You and I are in this together!
Don't you give up ever
Cause the end is not the answer!

The end is not the answer
You and I are in this together!
Don't you give up ever
Cause the end is not the answer!

I will never give up on you
I see the real you
Even if you don't, I do, I do
I will never give up on you
I see the real you
Even if you don't, I do, I do

And I'll show you the road to follow
I'll keep you safe till tomorrow
I'll pull you away from sorrow
I see the real you
Even if you don't, I do

If you're the one to run, to run
I'll be the one, the one you run to
If you're the one, to run, to run
I'll be the one, the one you run to

I will never give up on you
I see the real you
Even if you don't, I do, I do
I will never give up on you
I see the real you
Even if you don't, I do, I do

And it seems like I've known you forever
I'll keep you sane for one more night
Need you to know that it's alright
I see the real you
Even if you don't, I do
(I do)

If you're the one to run, to run
I'll be the one, the one you run to
You're not the only lonely one
I see the real you
Even if you don't, I do
(I do, I do, I do)




Just let me say one thing
I've had enough
You're selfish and sorry
You'll never learn
How to love
As your world disassembles
Better keep your head up

Your name,
Your face is
All you have left now
Betrayed, disgraced
You've been erased

So long, so long
I have erased you
So long, so long
I've wanted to waste you
So long, so long
I have erased you
I have escaped
The bitter taste of you

Just let me clear my head
I think I've had too much
You're so disappointing
But you make good use of it

As your world disassembles
Better keep your head up

Your name,
Your face is
All you have left now
Betrayed, disgraced
You've been erased

So long, so long
I have erased you
So long, so long
I've wanted to waste you
So long, so long
I have erased you
I have escaped
The bitter taste of you

[guitar  solo]

Your name,
Your face is
All you have left now
Disgraced, betrayed
You've been erased

So long, so long
I have erased you
So long, so long
I've wanted to waste you
So long, so long
I have erased you
I have escaped
The bitter taste ...
I have escaped
The bitter taste of you




Tonight, my head is spinning

I need something to pick me up

Iâve tried but nothing is working

I wonât stop

I wonât say Iâve had enough

Tonight, I start the fire

Tonight, I break away

[Chorus:]

Break away from everybody

Break away from everything

If you canât stand the way

This place is

Take yourself to higher places


(ohhh, ohhh)


At night I feel like a vampire

Itâs not right 

I just canât give it up

Iâll try to get myself higher

Letâs go

Weâre going to light it up

Tonight we start the fire

Tonight we break away

[Chorus:]

Break away from everybody

Break away from everything

If you canât stand the way 

This place is

Take yourself to higher places


If you canât stand the way this place is

Take (take) yourself (yourself)

To higher places

[Chorus:]

Break away from everybody

Break away from everything

If you canât stand the way 

This place is

Take yourself to higher places


(ohhâ¦higher places)

(ohhâ¦to higher places)

(ohhâ¦higher places)

Take yourself to higher places




He wakes up haunted
With voices in his head
Nobody knows it but today
He won't go unnoticed
He can't forget
Can't forgive
For what they said
He's never been
So hurt but
Today the screaming
Is over

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe he needed to be wanted
Blame the family
Blame the bully
Maybe he needed to be wanted

She takes the long way home
Fighting her emotions
She's a loner but tonight
She won't go unnoticed
If she can't remember when
She loses her temper
Nobody knows her but tonight
The silence is over

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe she needed to be wanted
Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe she needed to be wanted

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe they needed
Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe they needed to be wanted
Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe they needed to be wanted

Took me down to the river
So I could drown, drown, drown
Looking up through the water
I kept sinking down, down, down

I feel like I'm dying
I got one foot in the ground
Never knew what love was
Until you came around

[Chorus:]
You're going down
You're going down, down
You walked all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down

Take you down to the basement
You look around-round-round
We sit there in silence
I watched you go down, down, down

I feel like I'm flying
I got my head in the clouds
Never thought I was crazy
Until you came around

[Chorus:]
You're going down
You're going down, down
You walked all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down

You're going down, down
You walked all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down

Took me down to the river
So I could drown, drown, drown

[Chorus:]
You're going down
You're going down, down
You walked all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down (down, down, down)

You're going down, down (down)
You walked all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down




She just walked away
Why didn't she tell me?
And where do I go tonight?
This isn't happening to me
This can't be happening to me
She didn't say a word
Just walked away

You were the first to say
That we were not okay
You were the first to lie
When we were not alright
This was my first love
She was the first to go
And when she left me for you
I was the last to know

Why didn't she tell me
Where to go tonight?
She didn't say a word
She just walked away

You were the first to say
That we were not okay
You were the first to lie
When we were not alright
This was my first love
She was the first to go
And when she left me for you
I was the last to know

I'll be the first to say
That now I'm okay
And for the first time
I've opened up my eyes
This was my worst love
You'll be the first to go
And when she leaves you for dead
You'll be the last to know [2x]




You say you feel so down,

Every time I turn around

You say you should've

Been gone by now,

You think that everything's wrong,

Ask me how to carry on,

We'll make it through

Another day

Just hold on


Cause life starts now,

You've done all the things

That could kill you somehow

And you're so far down

But you will survive this

Somehow because

Life starts now


I hate to see you fall down,

I'll pick you up off the ground,

I've watched the weight of

Your world come down

And now it's your chance

To move on, change the way you've lived for so long,

Find the strength you've had inside all along


Cause life starts now,

You've done all the things

That could kill you somehow

And you're so far down

But you will survive this

Somehow because

Life starts now


All this pain

Take this life and make it yours,

All this hate

Take your heart and let it love again,

You will survive this somehow


Life starts now,

You've done all the things

That could kill you somehow

And you're so far down


Life starts now,

You've done all the things

That could kill you somehow

And you're so far down

Life starts now




I always knew
That you'd come back to get me
And you always knew
That it wouldn't be easy
To go back to the start
To see where it all began
Or end up at the bottom
To watch how it all ends

You tried to lie and say 
I was everything
I remember when I said
I'm nothing without you
I'm nothing without you

Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you
Let me inside
Let me get close to you
Change your mind
I'll get lost
If you want me to
Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you

You always thought
That I left myself open
But you didn't know
I was already broken
I told myself
That it wouldn't be so bad
But pulling away
You took everything I had

You tried to lie and 
Say I was everything
I remember when I said 
I'm nothing without you 
I'm nothing without you

Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you
Let me inside
Let me get close to you
Change your mind
I'll get lost
If you want me to
Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you
In you

The pain of it all
The rise and the fall
I see it all
In you
Now everyday
I find myself say
I want to get lost in you
I'm nothing without you

Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you
Let me inside
Let me get close to you
Change your mind
I'll get lost
If you want me to but
Somehow I found 
Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you 
A way to get lost in you 
A way to get lost in you




Give me a reason
To stay here
Cause I
Don't want
To live in fear
I can't stop
The rain
But I can stop
The tears
I can fight
The fire
But I can't fight
The fear

No more
I just can't
Live here
No more
I can't take it
Can't take it
No more
What do we
Stand for
When we all
Live in fear?

Give me a reason
To believe
Cause you don't
Wanna see me leave
I can't stop
The rain
But I can stop
The tears
Oh, I can fight
The fire
But I can't fight
The fear

No more
I just can't
Live here
No more
I can't take it
Can't take it
No more
What do we
Stand for
When we all
Live in fear?

No more
I just can't
Live here
No more
I can't take it
Can't take it
No more
What do we
Stand for
When we all
Live in fear?




Every street in this city
Is the same to me
Everyone's got a place to be
But there's no room for me
Am I to blame?
When the guilt and the shame
Hang over me
Like a dark cloud that
Chases you down
In the pouring rain

It's so hard
To find someone
Who cares about you
But it's easy enough to find
Someone who looks down on you
Why is it so hard
To find someone
Who cares about you
When it's easy enough to find
Someone who looks down on you?

It's not what it seems
When you're not on the scene
There's a chill in the air
But there's people like me
That nobody sees
So nobody cares

Why is it so hard
To find someone
Who cares about you
When it's easy enough to find
Someone who looks down on you?
Why is it so hard to find
Someone who can keep it
Together when you've come undone?
Why is it so hard
To find someone
Who cares about you?

I swear this time
It won't turn out the same
Cause now I've
Got myself to blame
And you'll know when we
End up on the streets
That it's easy enough to find
Someone who looks down on you

Why is it so hard
To find someone
Who cares about you
When it's easy enough to find
Someone who looks down on you?
Why is it so hard to find
Someone who can keep it
Together when you've come undone
Why is it so hard
To find someone
Who cares about you?




The good life is what I need
Too many people stepping over me
The only thing that's been on my mind
Is the one thing I need before I die

All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
The good life
All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
The good life

I don't really know who I am
It's time for me to take a stand
I need a change and I need it fast
I know that any day could be the last

All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
The good life
All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
The good life

Hold on, hold on
I always wanted it this way
We never wanted it this way

Hold on, hold on
I always wanted it this way
We didn't ask for it this way
I always wanted this way

The good life

All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
The good life
All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
The good life

The good life




What if I walked without you? What if I ran without you?

What if I stand without you? I could not go on

What if I lived without you?

What if I love without you?

What if I died without you?

I could not go on


You left my side tonight,

And I just don't feel right,

But I can't let you out of sight

Without you I'm no one,

I'm nothing at all


What if I lie without you?

What if I rise without you

And what if I dream  without you?

I could not go on


You left my side tonight,

And I just don't feel right,

But I can't let you out of sight

Without you I'm no one,

I'm nothing at all

Nothing at all




I never thought
I'd feel this
Guilty and I'm
Broken down inside
Living with myself
Nothing but lies

I always thought
I'd make it
But never knew I'd
Let it get so bad
Living with myself
Is all I have

I feel numb
I can't come to life
I feel like
I'm frozen in time

Living in a
World so cold
Wasting away
Living in a shell
With no soul
Since you've gone away
Living in a world so cold
Counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away

Do you ever feel me
Do you ever look
Deep down inside
Staring at yourself
Paralyzed

I feel numb
I can't come to life
I feel like
I'm frozen in time

Living in a
World so cold
Wasting away
Living in a shell
With no soul
Since you've gone away
Living in a world so cold
Counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away from me

I'm too young
To lose my soul
I'm too young
To feel this old
So long
I'm left behind
I feel like
I'm losing my mind

Do you ever feel me
Do you ever look
Deep down inside
Staring at your life
Paralyzed

Living in a
World so cold
Wasting away
Living in a shell
With no soul
Since you've gone away
Living in a world so cold
Counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away
From me

I'm too young [x2]




I can't escape this hell
So many times I've tried
But I'm still caged inside
Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can't control myself

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal
(This animal, this animal)

I can't escape myself
(I can't escape myself)
So many times I've lied
(So many times I've lied)
But there's still rage inside
Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can't control myself

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal

Somebody help me through this nightmare
I can't control myself
Somebody wake me from this nightmare
I can't escape this hell

(This animal
This animal
This animal
This animal
This animal
This animal
This animal)

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal
(This animal I have become)




No time for goodbye he said
As he faded away
Don't put your life in someone's hands
They're bound to steal it away
Don't hide your mistakes
'Cause they'll find you, burn you
Then he said

If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life

This is my last time she said
As she faded away
It's hard to imagine
But one day you'll end up like me
Then she said

If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life

If you wanna get out alive 
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life
If you wanna get out alive 
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life

If I stay it won't be long
'Til I'm burning on the inside
If I go I can only hope
That I make it to the other side

If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for

If you wanna get out alive 
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for your life
If you wanna get out alive 
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, oh, run for

If I stay, it won't be long
'Til I'm burning on the inside
If I go I can only hope
That I make it to the other side

If I stay, it won't be long
'Til I'm burning on the inside
If I go, and if I go

Burning on the inside
Burning on the inside
Burning on the inside




Don't know what's going on
Don't know what went wrong
Feels like a hundred years I
Still can't believe you're gone
So I'll stay up all night
With these bloodshot eyes
While these walls surround me with the story of our life

I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all
I'm not lying, denying that I feel so much better now
That you're gone forever

Now things are coming clear
And I don't need you here
And in this world around me
I'm glad you disappeared
So I'll stay out all night
Get drunk and fuck and fight
Until the morning comes I'll
Forget about our life

I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all
I'm not lying, denying that I feel so much better now
That you're gone forever

First time you screamed at me
I should have made you leave
I should have known it could be so much better
I hope you're missing me
I hope I've made you see
That I'm gone forever

And now it's coming clear
That I don't need you here
And in this world around me
I'm glad you disappeared

I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all
I'm not lying, denying that I feel so much better now
That you're gone forever
And now you're gone forever
And now you're gone forever




Your bottles' almost empty

You know this can't go on

Because of you my mind is always racing

The needles' breaking your skin

The scar is sinking in

And now your trip begins but

It's all over for

It's all over for


You

For you

When you're on the edge and falling off

It's all over for you

For you

When you're on the edge and falling off

It's all over


I know what runs through your blood

You do this all in vain

Because of you my mind is always racing

And it gets under my skin

To see you giving in

And now your trip begins but

It's all over for

It's all over for


You

For you

When you're on the edge and falling off

It's all over for you

For you

When you're on the edge and falling off

It's all over


And now you're dead inside

Still you wonder why

It's all over

And now you're dead inside

Still you wonder why

It's all over


And now you're dead inside

Still you wonder why

When you're on the edge and falling off

It's all over for (You, for you)

And now you're dead inside

Still you wonder why

When you're on the edge and falling off

It's all over for (You, for you)

And now you're dead inside

Still you wonder why

It's all over




We had fire in our eyes

In the beginning I

Never felt so alive

In the beginning you

You blame me but

It's not fair when you say that I didn't try

I just don't want to hear it anymore


I swear I never meant to let it die

I just don't care about you anymore

It's not fair when you say that I didn't try

I just don't care about you anymore


We had time on our side

In the beginning we

We had nothing to hide

In the beginning you

You blame me but

It's not fair when you say that I didn't try

I just don't want to hear it anymore


I swear I never meant to let it die

I just don't care about you anymore

It's not fair when you say that I didn't try

I just don't care about you anymore


You say that I didn't try

You say that I didn't try

You say that I didn't try


I swear I never meant to let it die

I just don't care about you anymore

It's not fair when you say that I didn't try

I just don't care about you anymore

I just don't care about you anymore

I just don't care about you anymore

I just don't care about you anymore

I just don't care about you anymore




This world will never be
What I expected
And if I don't belong
Who would have guessed it?
I will not leave alone
Everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late
It's never too late

Even if I say
It'll be alright.
Still I hear you say
You want to end your life.
Now and again we try
To just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late

No one will ever see
This side reflected
And if there's something wrong
Who would have guessed it?
And I have left alone
Everything that I own
To make you feel like
It's not too late
It's never too late

Even if I say
It'll be alright.
Still I hear you say
You want to end your life.
Now and again we try
To just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late

The world we knew
Won't come back
The time we've lost
Can't get it back
The life we had
Won't be ours again

This world will never be
What I expected
And if I don't belong

Even if I say
It'll be alright.
Still I hear you say
You want to end your life.
Now and again we try
To just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late

Maybe we'll turn it around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late (It's never too late)
It's not too late
It's never too late




I walk alone

Think of home

Memories of long ago

No one knows I lost my soul long ago


Lied too much

She said that she's had enough

Am I too much

She said that she's had enough


Standing on my own

Remembering the one I left at home

Forget about the life I used to know

Forget about the one I left at home


I need to run far away

Can't go back to that place

Like she told me

I'm just a big disgrace


Lied too much

She said that she's had enough

Am I too much

She said that she's had enough


Standing on my own

Remembering the one I left at home

Forget about the life I used to know

Forget about the one I left at home

So now I'm standing here alone

I'm learning how to live life on my own


Lied too much

I think that I've had enough

Am I too much

She said that she's had enough


I'm standing on my own

Remembering the one I left at home

Forget about the life I used to know

Forget about the one I left at home

So now I'm standing here alone

I'm learning how to live life on my own

Forget about the past I'll never know

Forget about the one I left at home




Do you think about

Everything you've been through

You never thought you'd be so depressed

Are you wondering

Is it life or death

Do you think that there's no one like you


We are

We are

We are

We are the ones

We get knocked down

We get back up and stand above the crowd

We are one

We are the ones

We get knocked down

We get back up and stand above the crowd

We are one


The life I think about

Is so much better than this

I never thought I'd be stuck in this mess

I'm sick of wondering

Is it life or death

I need to figure out who's behind me


We are

We are

We are

We are the ones

We get knocked down

We get back up and stand above the crowd

We are one

We are the ones

We get knocked down

We get back up and stand above the crowd

We are one


The life I think about

Is so much better than this

I never thought I'd be stuck in this mess

I'm sick of wondering

Is it life or death?


We are the ones

We get knocked down

We get back up and stand above the crowd

We are one

We are the ones

We get knocked down

We get back up and stand above the crowd

We are one


We stand above the crowd

We stand above the crowd

We stand above the crowd (Crowd)

(We stand) We stand above the crowd

We stand above the crowd (We Stand)

We stand above the crowd


(We are the ones) We stand above the crowd

(We get knocked down get back up) We stand above the crowd

(We are the ones) We stand above the crowd

(We get knocked down get back up) We stand above the crowd


We stand above the crowd

We stand above the crowd

We stand above the crowd




I feel it everyday it's all the same

It brings me down but I'm the one to blame

I've tried everything to get away

So here I go again

Chasing you down again

Why do I do this?


Over and over, over and over

I fall for you

Over and over, over and over

I try not to


It feels like everyday stays the same

It's dragging me down and I can't pull away

So here I go again

Chasing you down again

Why do I do this?


Over and over, over and over

I fall for you

Over and over, over and over

I try not to

Over and over, over and over

You make me fall for you

Over and over, over and over

You don't even try


So many thoughts that I can't get out of my head

I try to live without you, every time I do I feel dead

I know what's best for me

But I want you instead

I'll keep on wasting all my time


Over and over, over and over

I fall for you

Over and over, over and over

I try not to

Over and over, over and over

You make me fall for you

Over and over, over and over

You don't even try to




Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

You're sick of feeling numb
You're not the only one
I'll take you by the hand
And I'll show you a world that you can understand
This life is filled with hurt
When happiness doesn't work
Trust me and take my hand
When the lights go out you will understand

Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

Anger and agony
Are better than misery
Trust me I've got a plan
When the lights go off you'll understand

Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing
Rather feel pain

I know (I know I know I know)
I know that you're wounded
You know (You know you know you know)
That I'm here to save you
You know (You know you know you know)
I'm always here for you
I know (I know I know I know)
That you'll thank me later

Pain, without love
Pain, can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Rather feel pain than nothing at all
Rather feel pain




If you feel so empty
So used up, so let down
If you feel so angry
So ripped off so stepped on
You're not the only one
Refusing to back down
You're not the only one
So get up

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot

If you feel so filthy
So dirty so fucked up
If you feel so walked on
So painful so pissed off
You're not the only one
Refusing to go down
You're not the only one
So get up

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot

If you feel so empty
So used up, so let down
If you feel so angry
Just get up

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot




I'm thinking to myself

That I've done something wrong

That I've crossed the line

Have you found out this time 

What led you to believe 

It's only you and me 

Do you see it in my eyes 

Have you found out this time

[Chorus:]

You see right through me 

Cause you're running away 

You keep turning your back on me 

I tried so hard 

But you're running away 

Please dont turn your back on me


I'm drinking by myself 

And oh, I'm going down 

But will you pick me up 

Will you leave me on the ground 

I led you to believe 

It's only you and me 

I can see it in your eyes 

That you found out this time

[Chorus]


Don't just turn and walk away 

I can learn from my mistakes 

Don't throw everything away


You see right through me 

Cause you're running away 

You keep turning your back on me 

I tried so hard 

But you're running away

But you're running away 

[Chorus]




On the ground I lay
Motionless in pain
I can see my life flashing before my eyes
Did I fall asleep?
Is this all a dream
Wake me up, I'm living a nightmare

I will not die (I will not die)
I will survive

I will not die, I'll wait here for you
I feel alive, when you're beside me
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying

On this bed I lay
Losing everything
I can see my life passing me by
Was it all too much
Or just not enough
Wake me up, I'm living a nightmare

I will not die (I will not die)
I will survive

I will not die, I'll wait here for you
I feel alive, when you're beside me
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying

I will not die, I'll wait here for you
I feel alive, when you're beside me
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying

I will not die, I'll wait here for you
(I feel alive)
I will not die, when you're beside me
(feel alive)
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
(feel alive)
In my time of dying




The world was on fire and no one would save me but you.
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do.
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you.
And I'd never dream that I knew somebody like you.

No, I don't wanna fall in love.
No, I don't wanna fall in love.
With you.

What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way.
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you.
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way.
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you.

No, I don't wanna fall in love.
No, I don't wanna fall in love.
No, I don't wanna fall in love.
No, I don't wanna fall in love.
With you.

The world was on fire and no one would save me, but you.
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do.

No, I don't wanna fall in love.
No, I don't wanna fall in love.
No, I don't wanna fall in love.
No, I don't wanna fall in love.
With you.




You'd said we'd never get this far

You said your words, we've played our parts

Said your two cents now

It's my turn

So, sit down, shut up

Are you ready?


So, you think you know how this story goes

Are you ready for this?


Sit down, are you ready for this?

Shut up, are you ready for this?

Stand up, are you ready for this?

Restrain

Are you ready?


I thought you'd never come this far

I thought your words meant something more

Said my two cents now

It's your turn

So stand up and scream

Are you ready?


So you think you know how this story goes

Are you ready for this?


Sit down, are you ready for this?

Shut up, are you ready for this?

Stand up, are you ready for this?

Restrain

Are you ready?


Are you ready?

Are you ready for this?


Sit down, are you ready for this?

Shut up, are you ready for this?

Stand up, are you ready for this?

Restrain

Are you ready for this?




All this talk of getting old,
it's getting me down my love.
Like a cat in a bag waiting to drown.
This time I'm goin down.

And I hope your thinkin of me,
as you lay down on your side.
The drugs don't work they just make you worse
but I know I'll see your face again.

and I know I'm on a losing streak,
as I passed down by your street.
and if you want a show, just let me know
and I'll sing in your ear again.

Well drugs don't work,
they just make you worse
but I know ill see your face again

Cuz baby, ooh if heaven calls,
I'm coming too
just like you said, if you leave my life
I'm better off dead

all this talk of getting old,
its getting me down my love
like a cat in a bag, waiting to drown
this time I'm goin down.

cuz baby, ooh if heaven calls,
I'm coming too.
just like you said, if you leave my life
I'm better off dead.

now drugs don't work,
they just make you worse
but I know I'll see your face again

no the drugs don't work,
they just make you worse
but I know I'll see your face again

no the drugs don't work,
they just make you worse
but I know I'll see your face again




Can't stay forever, I know it 
Can't send for longer  than I meant to 
I breathe in silence 
Convince the thought 
It's not for you 

Strangely thought of all the things 
Passing out and falling down 

To greet a day 
When I can see two feet in front of me 
To be free of life 
If we can stand out in the rain 
It's a great old time 
For you to wonder why you are here 
To be free of life if we can stay 

It's not resolving in all these words 
The same, congruent 
And it's not the strong in 
In my man's hand 
That weights me down 

Strangely thought to all the things 
Passing out and falling down 

To greet a day 
When I can see two feet in front of me 
To be free of life 
If we can stand out in the rain 
There's a great old time 
For you to wonder why you are here 
To try to greet a greater life if we can stay 

Strange thought to mourn the flies 
Passing out and falling down 

To greet a day 
When I can see two feet in front of me 
To be free of life 
If we can stand out in the rain 
It's a great old time for you to 
For you to wonder why you 
Why you, why you, why...




Can you feel it?
Essence weak in this room
Designing all the paintings on the wall
And its the right
That sets me in despair
It's ornamental
When I beg for you

So, you want it that way?
Don't you talk, just listen
I wait for this to be over
So I'll start!

It doesn't show
And we're not well behaved
Its always there when you're not expecting it
So you complain
You legs are tired
Sit in my chair
Don't fall through it

So, you want it that way?
Don't you talk, just listen
I wait for this to be over,
So I'll..

(I'm never gonna get my own life, no) [4x, Crescendo]
I'm never gonna get my own life, no [4x]




Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we can still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
You had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody
That I used to know
Somebody
That I used to know
Somebody
That I used to know
Somebody
That I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know




The lights are bright,
They make me sweat
They make me swim this
Night I won't forget
Then people scream,
What do they mean
And I think they like us,
Yes that's what it seems

Facing the open door,
What will he see,
This paper in hand,
And it's a contract I think
Now come and tell me,
While I'm soaring away
I wanna be a big one
Where everyone stares.
Now give it to me while
I'm soaring away
I wanna be a big one
Where everyone stares.

Just a blur of hands like a silhouette,
What do I do now, oh I forget
Those people scream,
I wish I knew what they mean,
I think they like us,
Yes that's what it seems

Facing the open door,
What will he see,
This paper in hand,
And it's a contract I think
Now come and tell me,
While I'm soaring away
I wanna be a big one
Where everyone stares.
Now give it to me while
I'm soaring away
I wanna be a big one
Where everyone stares.

Now come and tell me,
While I'm soaring away
I wanna be a big one
Where everyone stares.
Now give it to me while
I'm soaring away
I wanna be a big one
Where everyone stares




Listen to the wind blow...
Watch the sun rise.
Running in the shadows...
Damn your love, damn your lies.

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again!
I can still hear you say it; you would never break the chain (never break the chain).
And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again!
I can still hear you say it; you would never break the chain (never break the chain).

Listen to the wind blow...
Down comes the night.
Running in the shadows...
Damn your love, damn your lies.
Break the silence...
Damn the dark, damn the light.

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again!
I can still hear you say it; you would never break the chain (never break the chain).
And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again!
I can still hear you say it; you would never break the chain (never break the chain).

Ohhh! Keep it together!
Ohhh! Keep it together!
Ohhh! Keep it together! I'll run in shadow!
Ohhh! Keep it together! I'm running in the shadows!
Ohhh! Keep it together! I'm still running in the shadows!
Ohhh! Keep it together! I'll run in the shadows!
I'm running in the shadows!
I'm still running in the shadows!




What, soothing, bizzare world
It was over when you woke up
The bleach stains on the fingers
Move over and let me through

All your useless words don't scare me
I won't play your pictionary
Take me, break me to inflare me
Watch me take these trips that scare me

If I surrender here and defy time, so sorry, come on
Would you leave me, leave me to die?
Would you leave me, chase me in the sky around?
There comes a time where you're so sorry
Here...

Filming, the long moan
Stretch your legs over me
This horror movie
Was over when you woke up

All your useless words don't scare me
I won't play your pictionary
Take me, break me to inflare me
Watch me take these trips that scare me

If I surrender here and defy time, so sorry, come on
Would you leave me, leave me to die?
Would you leave me, chase me in the sky around?
There comes a time where you're so sorry
Here...

All your useless words don't scare me
I won't play your pictionary
Take me, break me to inflare me
Watch me take these trips that scare me!

All your useless words don't scare me
I won't play your pictionary
Take me, break me to inflare me
Watch me take these trips that scare me!




You're all invited by
By something as good as me
You're frightened by my sentiment
What do you want to be?

You want to be my TV
Change your format 'til I say when
You want to feel my breathing
Take a dive into this deep end
And you walk across my ceiling
Trip and fall until I say when
You want to be my TV
Take dive into it

You're all divided by
Something as good as me
You're frightened by my sentiment 
What do you want to be?

You want to be my TV
Change your format 'til I say when
You want to feel my breathing
Take a dive into this deep end
And you walk across my ceiling
Trip and fall until I say when
You want to be my TV
Take dive into it

This soul is undecided...
This soul is undecided...

What do you want from me?
What do you want to be?
What do you want to be?
What do you want from me?
What do you want me to say? 
What do you want from me?




I don't like staying at home
When the moon is bleeding red
Woke up stoned in the backseat
From a dream where my teeth fell out of my head

Cut it up, cut it up, yeah
Everybody's on something here
My godsend chemical best friend
Skeleton whispering in my ear

Walk with me to the end
Stare with me into the abyss
Do you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far down it is

Nothing is fun
Not like before
You don't get me high anymore
Used to take one
Now it's takes four
You don't get me high anymore

Runnin' through emergency rooms
Spinning wheels and ceiling fans
My hand shake cellophane landscape
Mannequin fakin' it the best I can.

It's Cadillac, Cadillac red
No hands on the steering wheel
I'm crashing this save-a-ho Puppet show UFO
Obliterate the way I feel

Walk with me to the end
Stare with me into the abyss
Do you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far down it is

Nothing is fun
Not like before
You don't get me high anymore
Used to take one
Now it's takes four
You don't get me high anymore
You don't get me high anymore
You don't get me high anymore

Walk with me to the end
Stare with me into the abyss
Do you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far down it is

Nothing is fun
Not like before
You don't get me high anymore
Used to take one
Now it's takes four
You don't get me high anymore

high anymore
high anymore
high anymore
high anymore




All the key-bump thrills
All the suicide pills
Take the dose you swear by
Multiply ten times
From the bathroom stalls
Through the hotel walls
Watch the faded ladies
On fake eighties

And we're doing it 'til we die

Chasing the first time
The first high
Anything to get to where we were
Like the first time
Like the first high
And we're doing it 'til we die
Chasing the first time

All the smoke and mirrors
Can't quite calm the fear
Cause the past it hurt ya
You medicate the future

And we're doing it 'til we die

Chasing the first time
The first high
Anything to get to where we were
Like the first time
Like the first high
And we're doing it 'til we die
Chasing the first time
The first high
Anything to get to where we were
Like the first time
Like the first high
And we're doing it til we die
Chasing the first time

Nothing lasts forever, no
All we are is temporary
Nothing lasts forever, no
All we are is temporary
Spend our lives searching for
That once in a lifetime

And we're doing it 'til we die

Chasing the first time
The first high
Anything to get to where we were
Like the first time
Like the first high
And we're doing it 'til we die
Chasing the first time
The first high
Anything to get to where we were
Like the first time
Like the first high
And we're doing it 'til we die
Chasing the first time




I'm on the outside looking through
I know I'm not the same as you
I'd rather be faceless and ignored
Than being the in-crowd desperate for
A way to fit in just a little more (Oh)

I am an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
Better off on my own now
I'm an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
I'm better off on my own now

I don't wanna be any part of your scene (Oh)
I don't believe what you believe (Oh)
I'd rather be faceless in the dark
Than be so fake like the way you are
Yeah that's why I stay so far
Away from you

I am an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
Better off on my own now
I'm an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
I'm better off on my own now

There comes a time we draw the line
Decide we're better off on the outside
Better off on the outside (Whoa)
There comes a time we draw the line
Decide we're better off on the outside (Oh, oh)

I am an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
Better off on my own now
I'm an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
I'm better off on my own now




(From the darkness I see the light in you)

Don't stress, don't stress
No one knows what goes on in our heads, our heads
We are invisible to the rest, the rest
They don't know nothing 'bout what we have, we have

'Cause everyone's living in black and white
But we see each other in a different light

Infra-Red
I know that you're burning up for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you

In Infra-Red
The heat and the light and the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
I see you, I see you

It's okay, okay
They won't understand us anyway, no
You and I are on a different wave
So, doesn't even matter what they say (No)

'Cause everyone's living in black and white
But we see each other in a different light

Infra-Red
I know that you're burning up for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you

In Infra-Red
The heat and the light and the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
I see you, I see you

Everyone's living in black and white
We see each other in a different light
That's why I look at you like I do
Like nobody else is even in the room

We see each other in a different light...

Infra-Red
I know that you're burning up for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you

In Infra-Red
The heat and the light and the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
If you fall into me, I fall into you
I see you, I see you

(From the darkness I see the light in you)




I go all in, in love and life
But I can't take another sudden goodbye

Deep, deep down inside
Tell me...

Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?

I have to ask 'cause I need something to last
Too many times I've been left behind

Deep down inside
Tell me...

Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?

Deep, deep down inside
Deep, deep down inside
Tell me...

Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?
Will you love me or leave me forever?




You need to get this straight
I will never cooperate with you
You try to control me
And the pain I feel seems to make you happy

Fuck that
I'm down so low I've got nothing to lose
Won't put thoughts in my head trying to tell me what to do
Fuck that
And every step you think I'm under your shoe
If you're breaking my back, I'll be breaking yours too

If you've got something to prove
You against me, me against you
If you've got something to prove
You against me, me against you

Here we go again
You think you're in my head and under my skin
There's nothing you can throw at me
You can't win against my kind of crazy

Fuck that
I'm down so low I've got nothing to lose
Won't put thoughts in my head trying to tell me what to do
And every step you think I'm under your shoe
If you're breaking my back, I'll be breaking yours too

If you've got something to prove
You against me, me against you
If you've got something to prove
You against me, me against you

You against me, me against you
You against me, me against you

So if you've got something to prove
You against me, me against you
If you've got something to prove
You against me, me against you
You against me, me against you




I stay up every night
I should've thought twice when I put our lives on the line
I'm a mess
You're the only hope that I hold inside

The self-destruction, the damage I've done
You're the reason I'm still alive

And I lose it everyday inside of my head
I don't know if I'll be alright
I wanna leave it all behind
I've got nothing to lose

I've got nothing to lose but you
Nothing to lose but you
I know that I can't undo
The self-destruction, the damage I've done
I've got nothing to lose but you

Take a step, I will follow
Til the end of the earth
Through the best and the worst
Cause you know all my secrets
All my demons and you keep 'em in check

And I lose it everyday inside of my head
I don't know if I'll be alright
I wanna leave it all behind
I've got nothing to lose

I've got nothing to lose but you
Nothing to lose but you
I know that I can't undo
The self-destruction, the damage I've done
I've got nothing to lose but you

And I lose it everyday inside of my head
I don't know if I'll be alright
Cause if I didn't have you, I'd be better off dead
You're the reason I'm still alive

I've got nothing to lose but you
Nothing to lose but you
I know that I can't undo
The self-destruction, the damage I've done
I've got nothing to lose but you

And I lose it everyday inside of my head
I don't know if I'll be alright
Cause if I didn't have you, I'd be better off dead
You're the reason I'm still alive

I've got nothing to lose but you!




Sometimes I just wanna run away
Run away
Run away
I only wanna disappear
Far from here
Away from everyone
Before I come undone
The time has come
The time has come

So here I go
Left right left
Right left wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on
Moving on
Moving on

I've been thinking about it
Too much doubting
All of these feelings
Too many reasons to run
The time has come
The time has come

So here I go
Left right left
Right left wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on
Left right left
Right left wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on

I put my head down keep running away from it
Anywhere I'm going can't be worse than this
I need to get away before it pulls me in
And I'm never ever getting close to anyone again

I put my head down keep running away from it
Anywhere I'm going can't be worse than this
I need to get away before it pulls me in
I'm never ever getting close to anyone again
And I don't even know where I'm going to
But I don't want any motherfucking part of you
I've been waiting for this moment for way too long
I don't know where I'm going but I just keep moving on

Left right left
Right left wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on
Left right left
Right left wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on




Raise a glass to the end of it all
Who's to blame when it's everyone's fault?
And we celebrate our way through dangerous times
Strange days are comin' for us
Say goodbye to the way that it was
And we celebrate our way through dangerous times

I'm livin' in the strange days
I'm livin' in a world that I don't know
Get ready for the dark age
I'm livin' in the strange days so
Say goodbye to the silence
We can dance to the sirens
Strange days here we come
Strange days here we come
Strange days here we come

Never know when it's all goin' down
All I have is right here and now
So we'll make this moment last forever
And if we go we go together

I'm livin' in the strange days
I'm livin' in a world that I don't know
Get ready for the dark age
I'm livin' in the strange days so
Say goodbye to the silence
We can dance to the sirens
Strange days here we come
Strange days here we come
Strange days here we come

One of these nights
I'll take you down to the fire
With red in our eyes
We're gonna dance to the sirens
Say goodbye to the silence

(I'm livin' the strange days)

I'm livin' in the strange days so
Say goodbye to the silence
We can dance to the sirens
Strange days here we come
Strange days here we come
Strange days here we come




I can feel the energy
That changes in my chemistry
The atmosphere, the way I breathe
My automatic action is
To close my eyes and wander in
And wait until the madness ends
Lost communication with the world outside
I fall into my own, into the abyss

Lost inside my head, I open up the door
Step right off the ledge, into the abyss
Nothing that I know, I can't hear what you say
Am I already dead, into the abyss

Looking through distorted eyes
A mirror that I can't recognize
No way out, no exit signs
I try to make myself believe
I'm only in a lucid dream
It's like another world exists
I wanna go back into the abyss

Lost inside my head, I open up the door
Step right off the ledge, into the abyss
Nothing that I know, I can't hear what you say
Am I already dead, into the abyss

Lost communication with the world outside
So much devastation in my world I hide
I fall into my own, into the abyss

Lost inside my head, cracks across the floor
Step right off the ledge

Into the abyss
Nothing that I know, I can't hear what you say
Am I already dead, into the abyss




Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

Another night I'm barely holdin' on
One step away from being dead and gone
Am I alive to die another day?
Is this life that I've been livin'
All that's meant for me?

Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still survivin', keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

The higher I go, the harder I fall
So I don't look down, I don't look back at all
And when I wish it all would turn to black
I try to see the light and push the darkness back

Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still survivin', I keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

So If I'm numb, already too far gone
And If I feel a pulsin', I can carry on
When I'm lost and want to fade away
I tell myself to live to die another day, yeah

Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still alive and keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain, the mountain




Crazy the things that can turn a blind eye
Out on the street, all the people walk by
Nobody cares who gets pushed aside
As long as it's not gonna fuck with their own lives

Yeah, we're all a little guilty 'bout the vanity
Who we are and who we can't afford to be
Trying so hard to get the attention
Who's looking now is the burning question

Somebody special has a van-stick family
Somebody special took a trip last year
Somebody special drives a Maserati
Everyone's just trying to be somebody
Everyone's just trying to be somebody

Yeah we're all a little stunned by reality
What it is and what it's never going to be
Living everyday redundantly
Sounds like textbook insanity

Somebody special has a van-stick family
Somebody special took a trip last year
Somebody special drives a Maserati
Everyone's just trying to be somebody

Somebody special is a gangster wannabe
Somebody special turned a trick last year
Somebody special loves the paparazzi
Everyone's just trying to be somebody

Is this the new real?
(Is this the new real?)
Is this the new real?
(Is this the new real?)
When nobody cares about each other, how they feel
Is this the new real?
(Is this the new real?)
When nobody cares about each other, how they feel

Somebody special has a van-stick family
Somebody special took a trip last year
Somebody special drives a Maserati
Everyone's just trying to be somebody
Somebody special is a gangster wannabe
Somebody special just lives in fear
Somebody special is in love with molly
Everyone's just trying to be somebody

Is this the new real?
(Is this the new real?)
Is this the new real?
(Is this the new real?)
Is this the new real?




Go on take it out, take it out on me
'Cause you know I'm the only one who knows what you need
You want me, to be guilty, to be the one who's wrong
So easy, to blame me, it's been that way for so long

Go on, go on and hurt the one that you love
Go on and make me the one that you wanna hate if it makes you feel better
Go on, go on and give me the best that you've got
Go on and make me the villain I'm not
If it makes you feel better

I know no one's ever been there for you
And I know that you think I'm only gonna hurt you too
So you accuse me, that I'm guilty, like you want it all to go wrong
So easy, to blame me, it's been that way for so long

Go on, go on and hurt the one that you love
Go on and make me the one that you wanna hate if it makes you feel better
Go on, go on and give me the best that you've got
Go on and make me the villain I'm not
If it makes you feel better

I take the blame for you
Carry the weight for you
Tell me would you do the same for me?
(I don't think so)

Go on, go on and give me the best that you've got
Go on and make me the villain I'm not
If it makes you feel better

Go on, go on and give me the best that you've got
Go on and make me the villain I'm not
If it makes you feel better

I take the blame for you
Carry the weight for you
Tell me would you do the same for me?
(I don't think so)
(I don't think so)
(I don't think so)




Itâs not what I took from you

Itâs not what I stole

We are born like this

Like this


The time has come to change this

To stretch the thought a mile

Weâve lost that kind of spirit


We want it back today

The time is right to change this

To make the life we know

They took what we were given

Weâll get it back again


Somewhere someoneâs gun, someoneâs gun is laughing

Itâs not what I gave to you

Itâs now what I sold

We are born like this

(Like this)

Itâs not what I took from you

Itâs not what I stole

We are born like this


You try your best to mock me

Youâre always in my way

Youâve lost what youâve been given

Youâll get it back today


The time is right to change this

To make the life we know

They took what we were given

We want it back again

We are born like this

Itâs not what I took from you

Itâs not what I stole

We are born like this


Somewhere youâre floating high

Youâre not living

We are


Somewhere someoneâs gun, someoneâs gun is laughing, laughing

Itâs not what I gave to you

Itâs now what I sold

We are born like this

I'll tell you now you can't win this
You're way too slow
I'll tell you now I'm gonna take this
Did you come here to watch me, watch me burn?

I'll let it show that I'm not always hiding
Come all the way down
And watch me burn
I won't let it show that I'm not always flying
So on the way down
I'll watch you burn

So let me know just how to take this
You're way too cold
Now show me how before it breaks me
Did you come here to watch me, watch me burn?

I'll let it show that I'm not always hiding
Come all the way down
And watch me burn
I won't let it show that I'm not always flying
So on the way down
I'll watch you burn

No, oh

I'll let it show that I'm not always hiding
Come all the way down
And watch me burn
I won't let it show that I'm not always flying
So on the way down
I'll watch you burn




Good morning day

Sorry Iâm not there

But all my favourite friends

Vanished in the air

Itâs hard to fly when you canât even run

Once I had the world, but now Iâve got no one


If I needed someone to control me

If I needed someone to hold me down

I would change my direction

And save myself before I

If I needed someone to control me

If I needed someone to push me around

I would change my direction

And save myself before I drownâ¦.drown


Good morning day

Sorry youâre not here

All those times before

Weâre never this unclear

Itâs hard to walk when you canât even crawl

Once I had this world, but now Iâve lost it all


If I needed someone to control me

If I needed someone to hold me down

I would change my direction

And save myself before I

If I needed someone to control me

If I needed someone to push me around

I would change my direction

And save myself before I drown


Rolling faster than Iâm breathing

Drown

Rolling faster than Iâm breathing

Drown

Rolling faster than Iâm breathing


If I needed someone to control me

If I needed someone to hold me down

I would change my direction

And save myself before I

If I needed someone to control me

If I needed someone to push me around

I would change my direction

And save myself before I

(Save myself before I drown, save myself before I drown, save myself before I drown)




Iâll be coming home

Just to be alone

Cause I know youâre not there

And I know that you donât care

I can hardly wait to leave this place


No matter how hard I try

Youâre never satisfied

This is not a home

I think Iâm better off alone

You always disappear

Even when youâre here

This is not my home

I think Iâm better off alone

Home, home, this house is not a

Home, home, this house is not a home


By the time you come home

Iâm already stoned

You turn off the TV

And you scream at me

I can hardly wait

Till you get off my case


No matter how hard I try

Youâre never satisfied

This is not a home

I think Iâm better off alone

You always disappear

Even when youâre here

This is not my home

I think Iâm better off alone

Home, home, this house is not a

Home, home, this house is not a


Home, home, this house is not a

Home, home, this house is not a home


Iâm better off alone


No matter how hard I try

Youâre never satisfied

This is not a home

I think Iâm better off alone

You always disappear

Even when youâre here

This is not my home

I think Iâm better off alone

Home, home, this house is not a

Home, home, this house is not a


Home, home, this house is not a

Home, home, this house is not a home




Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet

Every roommate kept awake
By every sigh and scream we make
All the feelings that I get
But I still don't miss you yet

Only when I stop to think about it

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet

Only when I stop to think about it

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

Only when I stop to think about you
I know
Only when you stop to think about me
Do you know?

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
You hate everything about me
Why do you love me?

I hate
You hate
I hate
You love me

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

I'm alone, so I won't turn out like you

Want me to

In this time are we loving

Or do we sit here wondering

Why this world isnât turning round

Itâs now or never


We have no use

For the truth

And nowâs the time for us to lose

Who we are and how weâve tried

Taking every step in stride

It now or never to decide


In this time are we loving

Or do we sit here wondering

Why this world isnât turning round

Itâs now or never


In this way are we learning

Or do we sit here yearning

For this world to stop turning round

Itâs now or never


Whereâs the truth

For us to use

Cause all we seem to do is lose

Who we are and how weâve tried

Are we all the same inside

Itâs now or never to decide


In this time are we loving

Or do we sit here wondering

Why this world isnât turning round

Itâs now or never


In this way are we learning

Or do we sit here yearning

For this world to stop turning round

Itâs now or never


In this time are we loving

Or do we sit here wondering

Why this world isnât turning round

Itâs now or never


In this time are we loving

Why this world isnât turning round

Itâs now or never


In this way are we learning

Or do we sit here yearning

For this world to stop turning round

Itâs now or never


In this time are we loving,

Wondering

Isnât turning round

Itâs now or never




Worn out and faded

The weakness starts to show

Theyâve created the generation

That we know

Washed up and hated

The system moves to slow

They give us answers

To questions they donât even know


You made it

You played it

Your shit is overrated

You made it

You played it

Your shit is overrated


Used up and jaded

Youâre thinking way to slow

So weâre creating

Answers on our own

We canât relate

To what you think you know

And you create

The problems that will never

Go away


You made it

You played it

Your shit is overrated

You made it

You played it

Your shit is overrated


You made it

You played it

Your shit is overrated

Iâm not sober all the time

You bring me down at least you try

Until we see this eye to eye

I donât want you


I must be running out of luck

Cause youâre just not drunk enough to fuck

And now Iâve had it up to here

I donât, I donât want you


It took so long to see

You walked away from me

When I need you

Wake up Iâm pounding on the door

Iâm not the man I was before

Where the hell are you

When I need you

Wake up Iâm pounding on the door

I wonât hurt you anymore

Where the hell are you

When I need you


Iâm not angry all the time

You push me down at least you try

Until we see this eye to eye

I donât want you


It took so long to see

You walked away from me

When I need you

Wake up Iâm pounding on the door

Iâm not the man I was before

Where the hell are you

When I need you

Wake up Iâm pounding on the door

I wonât hurt you anymore

Where the hell are you

When I need you


It took so long to see

You walked away from me

In my mind worlds collide
Something inside me is gone
Still I keep going on
In my mind oceans divide
I donât know where I belong
But still I keep holding on and on

I get by in a world with no conscience
By shutting it out and being anonymous
And the problem is youâre just like me
We get by in a world with no conscience
By shutting it out and being anonymous
Hello, hello, hello

All we are is broken glass
Thrown to the floor we were never meant to last
And all we are are empty shells
Try to pick us up youâre gonna cut yourself

We march the streets at night
Looking for a thrill, looking for a fight
It was the first day of the rest of our lives
We work fast, never gonna die
Riding up the highway, forty-five
We didnât know it couldnât go on forever

All we are is broken glass
Thrown to the floor we were never meant to last
And all we are are empty shells
Try to pick us up youâre gonna cut yourself

We fought to rule the world
Not knowing just how fragile we really were
Like it was the first day of the rest of our lives
Then the bricks began to fall
And we can see the cracks along the wall
We didnât know it couldnât go on forever

All we are is broken glass
Thrown to the floor we were never meant to last
And all we are are empty shells
Try to pick us up youâre gonna cut yourself

We believe that we can go on forever
We believe that we can go on forever
Forever

All we are is broken glass
Thrown to the floor we were never meant to last
And all we are are empty shells
Try to pick us up youâre gonna cut yourself

You cut yourself
Youâre gonna cut yourself
Youâre gonna cut yourself




I've been cursed
I've been crossed
I've been beaten by the ones that get me off
I've been cut
I've been opened up
I've been shattered by the ones I thought I loved

You left me here like a chalk outline
On the sidewalk waiting for the rain
To wash away
Wash away
You keep coming back to the scene of the crime
But the dead can't speak and there's nothing left to say anyway
All you left behind
Is a chalk outline

I've been cold
In the crypt
But not as cold as the words across your lips
You'll be sorry baby
Some day
When you reach across the bed where my body used to lay

You left me here like a chalk outline
On the sidewalk waiting for the rain
To wash away
Wash away
You keep coming back to the scene of the crime
But the dead can't speak and there's nothing left to say anyway
All you left behind
Is a chalk outline
All you left behind
Is a chalk outline

(All you left behind...)

Baby, innocent
Is one day gonna be decadent
Prom Queen, Miss America
In the backseat in a pair of cuffs
Sixteen, little runaway
From the Five-O and you got away
From a small town with no scene
Looking for a shot on the big screen

Expectations
Go to hell
Expectations
Go to hell

Not so innocent
On the street hustling
Never be Miss America
In the backseat of a Celica
Crashing with a deadbeat
Living large on a love seat
In a small town, no scene
Turns out it was nothing but a pipe dream

Expectations
Go to hell
Expectations
Go to hell

Rich girl, wannabe
Bought a quick pick for the lottery
Watching TV with her boyfriend
Fell asleep, left the ticket on the nightstand
He stayed awake to see the ball drop
Turned it way down, she never woke up
Grabbed the keys to her car in the back lot
Threw a shot of Jack back, left with the jackpot

Expectations
Go to hell
Prom Queen, Miss America
In the backseat in a pair of cuffs

Expectations
Go to hell
Never be Miss America
In the backseat in a pair of cuffs




She always takes it with a heart of stone
âCause all she does is throw it back at me
Iâve spent a lifetime looking for someone

Donât try to understand me
Simply do the things I say

Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
âCause Iâm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me woman
Give in to me
Give in to me

You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me

Donât try to understand me
Because your words just are not enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Taken me higher
Love is a woman
Well I donât wanna hear it
Give in to me
Give in to me

You and your friends are laughing at me now
But itâs ok
Itâs ok

You wonât be laughing girl when Iâm not around
Iâll be ok
Iâm gonna find some peace of mind

(Give in to me)
(Give in to me)

Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
âCause Iâm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me woman
Give in to me
Give in to me

Love is a feeling
its taken me higher
Give it when I want it
âCause Iâm on fire
Talk to me woman
Give it when I want it
Give in to me
Give in to me




Feed on me
You know Iâm never far
Feed off me
Like a vulture on a deer hit by a car
I can only do so much
And of course itâs never enough
I donât think that you see
Exactly what youâre doing to me

Donât speak
Donât speak

Give me a reason to turn and run
Give me a reason to burn this house down
Give me a reason I wish you would
I wish you would
Wish you would

Give me a reason for disaster
And Iâll be happy ever after
Give me a reason I wish you would
I wish you would
Wish you would

So you've tried your best
To get out of this mess
But thatâs just a joke
Youâve never awoke
To the sound of a mother screaming at night

Donât speak
Donât speak

Give me a reason to turn and run
Give me a reason to burn this house down
Give me a reason I wish you would
I wish you would
Wish you would

Give me a reason for disaster
And Iâll be happy ever after
Give me a reason I wish you would
I'd wish you would
Wish you would

I wish you would
Wish you would
Wish you would
Wish you would
Wish you would

Give me a reason to turn and run
Give me a reason to burn this house down
Give me a reason I wish you would
I wish you would
Wish you would

Give me a reason for disaster
And Iâll be happy ever after
Give me a reason to turn and run
I wish you would
I wish you would




I reach out when I have a confession
I reach out in desperation
I reach out when no one is listening
So I go looking for the next best thing

Happiness straight from the bottle
When real lifeâs too hard to swallow
Happiness straight from the bottle
When real lifeâs too hard to swallow

I feel them judging on me for their own pleasure
If they really knew theyâd know better
That Iâm the one who caves under pressure
When desperate times call for desperate measures

Happiness straight from the bottle
When real lifeâs too hard to swallow
Happiness straight from the bottle
When real lifeâs too hard to swallow

I know thereâs got to be some peace in me
But I canât find it
I get so sick of looking

Happiness straight from the bottle
When real lifeâs too hard to swallow
Happiness straight from the bottle
When real lifeâs too hard to swallow

Too hard to swallow




I am in control
I haven't lost my mind
I am picking up the pieces
Of the past you left behind

I don't need your condescending
Words about me looking lonely
I don't need your arms to hold me
Cause misery is waiting on me

I am not alone
Not beaten down just yet
I am not afraid
Of the voices in my head
Down the darkest road
Something follows me
I am not alone
Cause misery loves my company
Misery loves my company

Leave me in the cold
You better run away
I'm gonna dig a hole
And bury all the memories we've made

I don't need your condescending
Words about me looking lonely
I don't need your arms to hold me
Cause misery is waiting on me

I am not alone
Not beaten down just yet
I am not afraid
Of the voices in my head
Down the darkest road
Something follows me
I am not alone
Cause misery loves my company
Misery loves my company

I am not alone
Not beaten down just yet
I am not afraid

Of the voices in my head
Down the darkest road
Something follows me
I am not alone
Cause misery loves my company
Misery loves my company




I know how youâre operating
Only come around when you know that I need it
Cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding
But youâre the only one that brings out the demon

Like pills you make me righteous
Like I can rise above it all
Like pills you leave me lifeless
Shaken in a bathroom stall

Why you wanna do this
Donât want to see you in my phone
Leave me alone

I know how youâre operating
Only come around when you know that I need it
Cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding
Youâre the only one that brings out the demon

You bring it out
You bring it out

Like pills you grab a hold of me
One hit just makes me want you more
Until weâre in a motel room
Locked up behind closed doors

Why you wanna do this
Donât want to see you in my phone
Leave me alone

I know how youâre operating
Only come around when you know that I need it
Cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding
Youâre the only one that brings out the demon

You bring it out
You bring it out

Youâre doing it now
Youâre doing it now
Youâre doing it now

It used to be
You brought out the best in me
Now it seems
You bring out the beast in me

I know how youâre operating
Only come around when you know that I need it
Cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding
You are the only one that brings out the demon

You bring it out
(You bring it out)
You bring it out
(You bring it out)
You bring it out
(You bring it out)




This is a sign of the times
Another mountain to climb
The sun burns as hot as the flame in the devil's eyes
This is a sign of the times
Another mountain to climb
The sun burns as hot as the flame in the devil's eyes

There's chaos on the rise
The sky is raining knives
We have mistaken
The toll that is taken on you and I
You and I
You and I
You and I

There's chaos on the rise
The sky is raining knives
We have mistaken
The toll that is taken on you and I

The oceans have all gone dry
Venus is passing by
You and I
You and I
You and I

There's chaos on the rise
The sky is raining knives
We have mistaken
The toll that is taken on you and I

I gave you what you need
I gave you what you need
You and
You and
You and
I gave what you need

We have mistaken
The toll that is taken on
We have mistaken
The toll that is taken on

I gave you what you need
I gave you what you need
I gave you what you need




I told you I was hurt
Bleeding on the inside
I told you I was lost
In the middle of my life

There's times I stayed alive for you
There's times I would've died for you
There's times it didn't matter at all

Will you help me find the right way up
Or let me take the wrong way down
Will you straighten me out
Or make me take the long way around
I took the low road in
I'll take the high road out
I'll do whatever it takes
To be the mistake you can't live without

Standing in the dark
I can see your shadow
You're the only light
That's breaking through the window

There's times I stayed alive for you
There's times I would've died for you
There's times it didn't matter at all

Will you help me find the right way up
Or let me take the wrong way down
Will you straighten me out
Or make me take the long way around
I took the low road in
I'll take the high road out
I'll do whatever it takes
To be the mistake you can't live without

Well I'm not gonna give it away
Not gonna let it go, just to wake up someday gone! Gone!
The worst part is looking back
And knowing that I was wrong

Help me find the right way up
Or let me take the wrong way down
Will you straighten me out
Or make me take the long way around
I took the low road in
I'll take the high road out
I'll do whatever it takes
To be the mistake you can't live without

I'll do whatever it takes
To be the mistake you can't live without




Donât do as I have done
Win where I have lost
Have where I have none
Donât let your demons drive
Theyâll just steer you wrong
You wonât get out alive

Because you canât unlive the pain
You canât rewind to yesterday
You might never find your place
In the time that remains
So if tomorrow never comes
From living fast and dying young
I hope the best is yet to come
In the time that remains for you

Donât get me wrong
The mistakes Iâve made along the way
Made me who I am today
The time is gonna come
You will wake up and realize
Just how fast your life goes by

Because you canât unlive the pain
You canât rewind to yesterday
You might never find your place
In the time that remains
So if tomorrow never comes
From living fast and dying young
I hope the best is yet to come
In the time that remains for you

Because you canât unlive the pain
You canât rewind to yesterday
You might never find your place
In the time that remains
So if tomorrow never comes
From living fast and dying young
I hope the best is yet to come
In the time that remains for you

The time that remains for you
For you
The time that remains
The time that remains

Hijacked when you werenât looking
Behind your back people are talking
Using words that cut you down to size
You want to fight back
Itâs building inside you
Holding you up
Taking you hostage
